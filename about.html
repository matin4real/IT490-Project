		<p>Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, this has forced many individuals to stay indoors. A good percentage of these individuals are playing online and video games in their free time. Our services will allow this influx of people to find their favorite games and provide them with information such as current players, number of peaked players, number of hours played etc.</p>
		<p>Our business objective is to make our site popular enough so that advertisers will want to put ads for their products on our services. This will add revenue to the already existing revenues, opportunities to exert control in choosing game, and socialization.</p>
		<p>By showing stats on how many players are playing a certain game on our services, this could help raise the revenues of it. Showing stats on a specific video game also gives the users the opportunity to exert control by weeding out all the video games they deem as “unpopular” or not interesting. Also, by creating these services, it creates an avenue for the users to socialize.</p>
